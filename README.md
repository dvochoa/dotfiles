# My Dotfiles

## Setup
1. Install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
2. Install brew packages by running `./brew-install-packages.sh`
3. Download or copy and paste the contents of whichever dotfiles you'd like to use and edit/remove the fields that seem
   inappropriate to you (e.g. the user information in `.git_config`). If you'd like you can also clone this repo and
   symlink its files to keep your dotfiles up to date with changes here.
4. Run `source <file_name>` after bringing in any changes so that they take effect immediately.

## Terminal Theme
I use the default MacOS Terminal App with the following settings:
- Basic Profile
- Hack Nerd Font Regular 12
- Antialias text disabled
- Block Cursor
- Blink Cursor enabled

## Future Improvements
- Could consider integrating with something like [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to make this more straightforward and feature rich.
- Include a more holistic install/setup script
